# ItanniX Quickstart Examples

Quickstart examples for integrating with the [ItanniX](https://itannix.com) voice AI platform.

## What is ItanniX?

ItanniX provides a real-time voice AI API that lets you add conversational AI to any device. Our API is compatible with OpenAI's Realtime API format, making it easy to integrate with existing code.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time voice conversations via WebRTC
- OpenAI Realtime API compatible
- Custom assistant configuration via dashboard
- Built-in function calling support
- Works on any device (browsers, IoT, mobile)

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account

Sign up at [app.itannix.com](https://app.itannix.com) to access the dashboard.

### 2. Register a Client

In the dashboard, go to **Clients** and register a new client. You can auto-generate a UUID for the Client ID.

### 3. Run an Example

Choose an example below and follow its README:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [JavaScript Browser](./javascript-browser/) | Browser-based client with WebRTC, no build step required |
| [Python](./python/) | Python client using aiortc for WebRTC support |

## Authentication

Each client needs two credentials:

- **Client ID**: A UUID that identifies your device (registered in the dashboard)
- **Client Secret**: A random string generated by your device on first connection (TOFU enrollment)

The first time a device connects with a secret, it is enrolled. Subsequent connections must use the same secret.
